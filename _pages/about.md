# About Me
* I am a research intern at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, working in the lab of Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/).
* My primary research interests include optimization of SGD algorithms and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and using Lagrangian-based RNNs to simulate physical systems. I have also worked with quantum computing machine learning algorithms such as Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs).
* I received my BSc from the Honours Physics & Computer Science program at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My undergraduate research advisor was Prof. [Michael Hilke](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~hilke/) with additional supervision from Prof. [Sabrina Leslie](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/leslielab/). My research focused on two-dimensional non-planar graphene structures and ML-based prediction of solid properties.
